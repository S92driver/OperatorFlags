Operator Flags for Basestation and VRS

These images all follow the standard format used by Basestation and VRS of 85 x 20 pixels.  They are high quality images of only the aircraft, they do not contain any additional text.

Due to my intention to capture all aircraft and livery differences, it has been necessary to highly customise the naming format.  Due to this, it is highly recommended that any user of these images also downloads the associated Basestation.sqb file.  This SQB file has been highly customised to automatically display the most appropriate OperatorFlag.

I welcome feedback and requests.  Please use the Issues part of this repository, or leave a message for me on Radarspotting: https://radarspotting.com/forum/index.php?board=68.0
